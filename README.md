# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
I started working on canvas development, made a template on codepen and created a game to test it.

The game is based on [No Tears Guide to HTML5 Games](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/) and it basically 
redoes most of it in es6 without using jquery and taking a composition + functional programming approach.

I missed Enemies and Collision

#### Thoughts
Canvas isn't so bad, I'm really looking forward to start drawing corgis and other stuff on it.

I really need to learn how to make smaller code, this took me way beyond an hour. I hope I get faster.

Everything i'm learning in elixir is paying off tho.

### Day 2: March 25, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
I decided to make a corgi twitter bot, because why not. I based myself on [this article by freecodecamp.](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/easily-set-up-your-own-twitter-bot-4aeed5e61f7f#.fxei87o1t)

The bot retweets and likes corgi stuff every 30 mins. It also has 10 unique responses for followers.

#### Thoughts
I always thought that twitter bots were a lot more complicated to make, i'm think of making a few more.

I really need to start doing projects that are not corgi related.

### Day 3: March 26, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
I was inspired by my girlfriend's success in the DailyCSSImages and decided to try out making my own CSS Image of a corgi, while also learning a little bit about keyframe animations.

#### Thoughts
CSS Drawings are tough. They're way more about actual design than they actually have to do with your hability to code them.

I need to get better at design. I also need to start making un-corgi projects.

### Day 4: March 27, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
Continued working with canvas today, always wanted to make particle animations, so I decided to make one.

Surprisingly, I wasn't able to stop at just animating particles, so I had to add some interactions.

#### Thoughts
Particles aren't so hard to make, and having them bounce and follow my mouse turned out to be a lot easier than I expected.

You can also click them and, who would have known, both effects added together result in particle explosions. This is amazing.

**Side note:** I actually made something that's fun to play with. I have never been this happy.

### Day 5: March 29, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
I decided to create a scaffold/starterpack for developing React + Redux + TypeScript Applications.

I then got frustrated at the difficulty of making Babel + TypeScript work together and decided to develop a quick codepen
Starter pack for this same purpose.

I will continue to work on this Starter Pack on the next few days to completion.

#### Thoughts
Creating setups is hard, but I really want to start using this one. 

This project is teaching me a lot of things about build tools and compilers in node, to which i'm grateful.

I got incredibly frustrated at not making it work with codeanywhere. Tomorrow, I will attempt cloud9.

### Day 6: March 30, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
I continued work on my react-redux-typescript-scaffold. I managed to add redux and babel to it, as well as improve the workflow and add hot module reload. It also now runs both locally and on cloud9.

I still need to do linting and testing. Thankfully that DOES work on codeanywhere. Should be done tomorrow.

#### Thoughts
It's beautiful to work on an IDE that isn't actively conspiring against me. Jokes aside, cloud9 is a beautiful development environment that I wish I had gotten to know sooner.

I learnt more about servers in Node, as well as how to pass arguments into my scripts. I'm also getting more familiar with react and redux using typescript. I'm going to need a project after this, I need to git gud.

I'm also really eager to start taking contributors, things like rules for linting, bugs, fixes and improvements are going to be **very** well received.

### Day 7: March 31, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
Added testing and linting to my TypeScript + Babel + React + Redux Starter Pack. I encountered trouble running enzyme and ran out of time for the day (It is 8pm after all.)

Maybe tomorrow I can finish this.

#### Thoughts
I learnt a lot about type declaration files and the ever changing world of JavaScript modules. I also learnt a lot about perseverance, as I was little away from quitting this project when Mocha/Chai refused to work with my setup (despite my attempts and asking nicely.)

However I'm proud to say I pushed through this and am now just two steps away from finishing this mini-project (Enzyme and Coverage.)
