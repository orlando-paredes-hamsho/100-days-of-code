# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
I started working on canvas development, made a template on codepen and created a game to test it.

The game is based on [No Tears Guide to HTML5 Games](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/) and it basically 
redoes most of it in es6 without using jquery and taking a composition + functional programming approach.

I missed Enemies and Collision

#### Thoughts
Canvas isn't so bad, I'm really looking forward to start drawing corgis and other stuff on it.

I really need to learn how to make smaller code, this took me way beyond an hour. I hope I get faster.

Everything i'm learning in elixir is paying off tho.

### Day 2: March 25, 2017 

#### Today's Progress
I decided to make a corgi twitter bot, because why not. I based myself on [this article by freecodecamp.](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/easily-set-up-your-own-twitter-bot-4aeed5e61f7f#.fxei87o1t)

The bot retweets and likes corgi stuff every 30 mins. It also has 10 unique responses for followers.

#### Thoughts
I always thought that twitter bots were a lot more complicated to make, i'm think of making a few more.

I really need to start doing projects that are not corgi related.
