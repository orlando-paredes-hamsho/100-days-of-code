# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**
I started working on canvas development, made a template on codepen and created a game to test it.

The game is based on [No Tears Guide to HTML5 Games](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/) and it basically 
redoes most of it in es6 without using jquery and taking a composition + functional programming approach.

I missed Enemies and Collision

**Thoughts**
Canvas isn't so bad, I'm really looking forward to start drawing corgis and other stuff on it.

I really need to learn how to make smaller code, this took me way beyond an hour. I hope I get faster.

Everything i'm learning in elixir is paying off tho.
